# Retro Toe

**Developer:** Blake Thollaug

**Project Description:** I engineered a fully functioning game application emulating tic tac toe using industry standard static webpage technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS).
    - Algorithms for game logic are written from scratch using a mere 100 lines of code.
    - Mobile-friendly UI layout utilizes relative units, and the CSS Flex and Grid modules for maximal responsivity across device viewports.
    - Deployment of application uses GitHub Pages.
