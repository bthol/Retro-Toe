# Tic-Tac-Toe
**Developer:** Blake Thollaug

**Description:** I engineered a fully functioning game application emulating tic tac toe using industry standard static webpage technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS).
- Wrote algorithms for game logic from scratch using a mere 100 lines of code.
- Made a mobile-friendly UI layout by utilizing relative units, and the CSS Flex and Grid modules for maximal responsivity across device viewports.
- Deployed the application using GitHub Pages.
